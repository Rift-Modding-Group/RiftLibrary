# RiftLib
RiftLib is a fork of GeckoLib 1.12.2, which adds some new features in addition to GeckoLib's already-present features.

A Blockbench plugin is available (here)[https://github.com/Rift-Modding-Group/RiftLibrary-Blockbench-Extension]. Currently it helps out on visually editing the dynamic hitboxes and even alows for previewing how they move while the model is animated, with support for editing visually rider positions to come soon.
